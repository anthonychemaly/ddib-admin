Hello Students,

We're thrilled to have you on board for our hands-on training session using the Hedera Hashgraph. Let's walk you through the steps to prepare for this enriching experience:

1. **Register at the Hedera Developer Portal:**
Your first step is to create a student account on the Hedera portal. Simply visit [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com/) to do this. The portal will provide you with a range of resources, updates, and specialized tools to support your learning process on the Hedera platform.

2. **Exploring Hedera Documentation:**
Before diving into the code, it's important to understand the Hedera platform. You can access the comprehensive Hedera documentation at [Hedera Documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/). It will act as your guidebook, providing crucial insights into the platform's terminology, architecture, and various components.

3. **Accessing GitHub Repository:**
Our project codes are stored in a GitHub repository, available at [Swiss Digital Assets Institute GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Swiss-Digital-Assets-Institute/training-hands-on). We encourage you to clone or download this repository onto your local system to facilitate easy access and management of the code.

Next, you'll need to decide how to access the code:

- **Option A: Coderbyte:** Coderbyte is a platform where we host our coding exercises and assignments. You can access it at [Coderbyte](https://hashgraph.coderbyte.com/sl-candidate?promo=thehashgraphassociation-w9cn2:javascript-assessment-fkm0jojyxv). Keep in mind that under heavy traffic, Coderbyte might experience some timeouts. If you encounter any such issues, wait for a few minutes and try again.

- **Option B: IDE Setup:** If you prefer working in your favorite IDE, such as Visual Studio Code, feel free to clone or download our GitHub repository there.

And with that, you're all set to start this exciting learning journey with us. We can't wait to see your progress and contributions.

**Happy Learning!**
